            Hello, my name is Eli Cohen, and I am from Memphis Tennessee. I am a big sports fan with my favorites being
            basketball and baseball. My favorite teams are the Memphis Grizzlies and the Atlanta Braves. I also enjoy
            playing video games, hanging out with friends, and watching movies and TV shows. I have a passion for
            programming and web design. I am always looking for new projects to work on. I am a hard worker with a
            willingness to learn and improve my skills. I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and better
            myself. I am a critical thinker that enjoys solving problems. They feel like a puzzle that I have to solve.
          </p>
          <p>
