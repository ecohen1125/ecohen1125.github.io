# Eli Cohen's Projects

My name is Eli Cohen, and I am a Computer Science major specializing in Software Engineering with minors in Informatics and Web Design.

## [In Color](https://github.com/ecohen1125/In-Color)

This is a project that was made in Xcode using Swift.
I was working in a team with Jacob Day and Evan Japundza, and this app was made for CSCI-C 323 Mobile App Development.
This app is a drawing app that has the ability to save drawings to be able to be viewed in a table view controller.



## [Memphis Grizzlies Fan Website](https://github.com/ecohen1125/MemphisGrizzliesFanWebsite)

This website was made for INFO-I 360 Web Design. 

This is the Home Page of the website. The navagation bar links to every page and is consistent throughout the website.

This is the image gallery that is on the Home Page. The arrows underneath it allow the user to look through all the photos.

This is the footer that is on every page. It has my name, ways to contact me, and my social media.

This is the table that is in the Roster page. It is a sortable that sorts the column based on which heading you click. An arrow will appear showing which direction it is currently being sorted.

This is the Schedule page. When either Home Games or Away Games is clicked, it will display only them. When it is pressed a second time, all games are shown.

This is the table in the Stats page. It is another sortable table like the one in the Roster page and has the same effects,

This is the Social Media page. It displays, using flexbox, different tweets that I liked from the Grizzlies community on Twitter.
