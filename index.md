# Eli Cohen's Projects

My name is Eli Cohen, and I am a Computer Science major specializing in Software Engineering with minors in Informatics and Web Design.

## [In Color](https://github.com/ecohen1125/In-Color)

This is a project that was made in Xcode using Swift.
I was working in a team with Jacob Day and Evan Japundza, and this app was made for CSCI-C 323 Mobile App Development.
This app is a drawing app that has the ability to save drawings to be able to be viewed in a table view controller.

This is the Canvas for drawing in the app. The user is able to touch the screen and a line will be drawn wherever one touches. There is a new canvas button in the top right that will reset the drawing. There is a save canvas button in the top rights that saves the drawing to be displayed in the table view controller. There is a random background button that asks the user for permisson to access their camera roll. It picks a random picture out of it to be displayed in the background. The user is then able to trace over it.

These are the setting that the user has to draw with. The user can change the color of the pencil that they draw with along with the color of the background. The slider allows the user to change the thickness of their pencil.

This is the table view controller that shows the user their saved drawings. It also has a button that lets the user share their drawing on social media or save it to their camera roll.

## [Memphis Grizzlies Fan Website](https://github.com/ecohen1125/MemphisGrizzliesFanWebsite)

This website was made for INFO-I 360 Web Design. I used the colors and brading of the team to make it feel like it fits with the Memphis Grizzlies.

This is the Home Page of the website. The navagation bar links to every page and is consistent throughout the website.

This is the image gallery that is on the Home Page. The arrows underneath it allow the user to look through all the photos.

This is the footer that is on every page. It has my name, ways to contact me, and my social media.

This is the table that is in the Roster page. It sorts the column based on which heading you click. An arrow will appear showing which direction it is currently being sorted.

This is the Schedule page. When either Home Games or Away Games is clicked, it will display only them. When it is pressed a second time, all games are shown.

This is the table in the Stats page. It is another sortable table like the one in the Roster page and has the same effects.

This is the Social Media page. It displays, using flexbox, different tweets that I liked from the Grizzlies community on Twitter.

## [Sleep, Rest, Diet, and Exercise](https://resilience-inc.itch.io/eat)

This is the game that I am working on during my internship with Relilience, Inc. This is a PC game that is designed to help children learn how to manage sleep, rest, diet, and exercise. This game is being made in Unity with maps made in Tiled. 

The Menu scene is what the player will see when they open the game. It lets the player start the game, change options like volume, quit, and see the credits. It will have a picture of the map in the background soon.

The apartment scene is where the player starts the game. The player is able interact with the fridge in order to answer some questions about being healthy. They will lose energy if the wrong food is picked. The player is also able to sleep to restore their energy.

The map is how the player goes from one location to the next. The player will click on the place they want to go to.

The restaurant is where the player has the option to eat healthy or unhealthy foods. Depending on what food is choosen, their energy will change accordingly.

The gym allows the player to increase their maximum energy. The player can work out and feel energised the next day.
